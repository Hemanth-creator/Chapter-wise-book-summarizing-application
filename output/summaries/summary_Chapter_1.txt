In 2003, Dave Brailsford became the performance director of British Cycling and introduced the strategy of "aggregation of marginal gains," which focuses on improving every aspect by 1% to achieve significant overall improvement. Brailsford made small adjustments such as redesigning bike seats, using alcohol on tires for better grip, electrically heated overshorts, biofeedback sensors, testing fabrics in wind tunnels, and having riders switch to indoor racing suits. The team's commitment to these marginal gains led to a dramatic change in the team's performance, with British cyclists winning multiple gold medals at the Olympic Games and the Tour de France in the following years.
