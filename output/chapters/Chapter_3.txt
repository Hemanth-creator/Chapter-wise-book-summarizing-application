How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple
Steps
N 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an
experiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of
how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was
interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by
working with cats.
He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The
box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some
simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or
stepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that,
when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door
had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.
Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the
box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws
through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of
exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door
would open, and they would escape.
Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In
the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as
soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of
learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of
pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to
the food.
After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and
habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,

Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.
