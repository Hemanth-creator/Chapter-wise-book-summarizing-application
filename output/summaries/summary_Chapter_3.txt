In 1898, psychologist Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment with cats and a puzzle box, which helped lay the foundation for understanding how habits form. Cats were placed in the box and had to perform a simple action, like pulling a cord or pressing a lever, to escape and reach food. Through trial and error, cats began to associate the action with the reward and, over time, learned to perform the action automatically to escape the box within a few seconds. This experiment demonstrated the process of habit formation, where behavior becomes automatic and associated with a reward.
