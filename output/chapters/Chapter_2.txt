How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and
Vice Versa)
HY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good
ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life
than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next
year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.
It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few
days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.
Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are
reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.
However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick
around forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best
intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much
television, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to
change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the
wrong way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters
that follow, I’ll answer the second.
Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To
understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which
change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.
THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your
outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is
concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a
book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are
associated with this level of change.
The second layer is changing your process. This level is
concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a
new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,
developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are
associated with this level.
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This
level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your
self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the
beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.
Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits
that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent
improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse”
than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The
problem is the direction of change.
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing
on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.
The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach,
we start by focusing on who we wish to become.

OUTCOME-BASED HABITS
IDENTITY-BASED HABITS
FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to
achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to
become.
Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the
first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a
reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker
who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will
change while carrying around the same beliefs.
The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a
smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in
identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.
They no longer identify as someone who smokes.
Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out
to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I
stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and
determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without
considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the
www.ztcprep.com
way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old
identity can sabotage their new plans for change.
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of
a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and
social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of
beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine
many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such
behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.
That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is
impossible under a certain set of beliefs.
A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,
organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions
that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may
want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes
rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending
rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to
prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing
rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never
change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have
a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.
The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,
provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed
my fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I
was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.
One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.
Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”
Then, Clark did something surprising.
“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My
thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t
chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What
happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the
first time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I
had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my
fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it
made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a
www.ztcprep.com
single close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring
for them.”
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes
part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who
wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person
who is this.
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the
more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If
you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to
care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,
you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re
proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours
knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth
and nail to maintain your habits.
True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit
because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that
it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to
visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the
belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term
changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of
who you are.
The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a
musician.
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do
is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either
consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a
person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more
likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who
identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who
simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.
Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity
doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is
easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,
www.ztcprep.com
you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like
the type of person you already believe yourself to be.
Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged
sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force
for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity
change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be
easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many
people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the
norms attached to their identity.
“I’m terrible with directions.”
“I’m not a morning person.”
“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”
“I’m always late.”
“I’m not good with technology.”
“I’m horrible at math.”
. . . and a thousand other variations.
When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to
slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you
begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is
internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that
is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid
contradicting yourself.
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the
more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what
your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-
image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to
positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity
conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with
your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re
too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.
Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits
is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too
attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning.

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit
your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and
worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they
come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?
And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve
you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?
THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset
beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and
conditioned through experience.*
More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity.
When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an
organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity
of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity
of an athletic person.
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity
associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally
derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and
identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your
“repeated beingness.”
Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you
have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you
have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour
every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the
gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed
to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly
you will believe it.
For most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you
were to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they
would tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout.
When I began my writing career, I published a new article every
Monday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so
did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I became one
through my habits.

Of course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your
identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most
important ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but
it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you
kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you
repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-
image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade
away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means
your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.
In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of
becoming yourself.
This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our
fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,
day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing
microevolutions of the self.
Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you
finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes
reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person
who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are
the type of person who likes music.
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to
become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes
build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason
why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits
can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new
identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the
paradox of making small improvements.
Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to
changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are
is to change what you do.
Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.
Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far
more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually
accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence
begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.
Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to
perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that
you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes
for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election;
you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a
bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the
majority of the time.
New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same
votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve
always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.
It is a simple two-step process:
